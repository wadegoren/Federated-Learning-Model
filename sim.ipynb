This is achieved via the [Virtual Client Engine](https://flower.ai/docs/framework/how-to-run-simulations.html) in Flower. With simulation, you can dynamically scale your experiments whether you run the code on your laptop, a machine with a single GPU, a server with multiple GPUs os even on a cluster with multiple servers. The `Virtual Client Engine` handles everything transparently and it allows you to specify how many resources (e.g. CPU cores, GPU VRAM) should be assigned to each virtual client."

And it is true!! In Federated Learning, the way clients perform local training makes use of the same principles as more traditional centralised setup. The key difference is that the dataset now is much smaller and it's never _\"seen\"_ by the entity running the FL workload (i.e. the central server).\n",

    "\n",
    "## Choosing a Flower Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A strategy sits at the core of the Federated Learning experiment. It is involved in all stages of a FL pipeline: sampling clients; sending the _global model_ to the clients so they can do `fit()`; receive the updated models from the clients and **aggregate** these to construct a new _global model_; define and execute global or federated evaluation; and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flower comes with [many strategies built-in](https://github.com/adap/flower/tree/main/src/py/flwr/server/strategy) and more to be available in the next release (`1.5` already!). For this tutorial, let's use what is arguable the most popular strategy out there: `FedAvg`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way `FedAvg` works is simple but performs surprisingly well in practice. It is therefore one good strategy to start your experimentation. `FedAvg`, as its name implies, derives a new version of the _global model_ by taking the average of all the models sent by clients participating in the round. You can read all the details [in the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how we can define `FedAvg` using Flower. We use one of the callbacks called `evaluate_fn` so we can easily evaluate the state of the global model using a small centralised testset. Note this functionality is user-defined since it requires a choice in terms of ML-framework. (if you recall, Flower is framework agnostic).\n",
    "\n",
    "> This being said, centralised evaluation of the global model is only possible if there exists a centralised dataset that somewhat follows a similar distribution as the data that's spread across clients. In some cases having such centralised dataset for validation is not possible, so the only solution is to federate the evaluation of the _global model_. This is the default behaviour in Flower. If you don't specify teh `evaluate_fn` argument in your strategy, then, centralised global evaluation won't be performed."

    "We could now define a strategy just as shown (commented) above. Instead, let's see how additional (but entirely optional) functionality can be easily added to our strategy. We are going to define two additional auxiliary functions to: (1) be able to configure how clients do local training; and (2) define a function to aggregate the metrics that clients return after running their `evaluate` methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `fit_config()`. This is a function that will be executed inside the strategy when configuring a new `fit` round. This function is relatively simple and only requires as input argument the round at which the FL experiment is at. In this example we simply return a Python dictionary to specify the number of epochs and learning rate each client should made use of inside their `fit()` methods. A more versatile implementation would add more hyperparameters (e.g. the learning rate) and adjust them as the FL process advances (e.g. reducing the learning rate in later FL rounds).\n",
    "2. `weighted_average()`: This is an optional function to pass to the strategy. It will be executed after an evaluation round (i.e. when client run `evaluate()`) and will aggregate the metrics clients return. In this example, we use this function to compute the weighted average accuracy of clients doing `evaluate()`."
